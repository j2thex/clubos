# Implementation Details

## Membership Expiration System

### Login Enforcement (Expired Members Blocked)

**Request:** Hard-block expired members at login — if `valid_till` is set and in the past, reject login with a localized error message showing the expiration date.

**Changes:** Added `valid_till` to the member select query in both `loginMember` and `loginStaff` actions. After the status check, compares `valid_till` against current date. Returns `t(locale, "login.membershipExpired", { date: formatted })` on expiry. Both actions now accept a `locale` parameter (passed from client) for translated error messages. Added `login.membershipExpired` and `login.membershipExpiredGeneric` i18n keys to both EN and ES dictionaries.

**How it works:** When a member or staff member tries to log in, the server action checks `valid_till`. If the date is in the past, login is rejected with a localized message like "Your membership expired on March 10, 2026. Contact your club to renew." The login page also handles `?expired=1` query param (from middleware redirects) to show a generic expiry banner before the user enters their code.

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/login/actions.ts` — `loginMember` checks `valid_till`, accepts `locale` param
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/login/actions.ts` — `loginStaff` checks `valid_till`, accepts `locale` param
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/login/page.tsx` — reads `?expired=1` search param, shows generic expiry banner
- `lib/i18n/dictionaries/en.json` — `login.membershipExpired`, `login.membershipExpiredGeneric`
- `lib/i18n/dictionaries/es.json` — same keys in Spanish

### Middleware Expiry Check (Mid-Session Protection)

**Request:** Redirect already-logged-in expired members on page load, so expiry is enforced even for active sessions.

**Changes:** Added a DB check in the member routes section of `middleware.ts` (after JWT verification). Queries `status, valid_till` from members table. If `valid_till` is past, deletes the member cookie and redirects to `/{clubSlug}/login?expired=1`. Skips the check for server actions (same pattern as staff status check).

**How it works:** On every member page load (not server actions), middleware queries the DB for `valid_till`. If expired, the auth cookie is deleted and the member is redirected to login with `?expired=1`. This adds one DB query per member page load — the same pattern already used for staff status checks.

**Key files:**
- `middleware.ts` — member route section, DB check for `valid_till` after JWT verify

### Staff Date Picker (Unified)

**Request:** Replace the "+Xmo" period-based extension button and separate "edit" link with a single unified date picker for all membership date management.

**Changes:**
- Removed `prolongateMembership()` function from `actions.ts` entirely
- Removed `assignMembershipPeriod` import and period dropdown from `member-row.tsx`
- Removed `Period` interface, `periods` prop, `membershipPeriodId`, and `periodDurationMonths` from `MemberInfo`
- Simplified UI: members with `validTill` show the date as a tappable button (color-coded: red=expired, amber=expiring soon, green=valid) that toggles an inline date picker. Members without `validTill` show a date input with a "Set" button.
- `setManualValidTill` now also clears `membership_period_id` (since it's a manual date) and logs as `validity_updated` (was `validity_set_manual`)
- Updated parent page `staff/(console)/members/page.tsx` to remove `periodMap` and simplified props

**How it works:** Staff members see one unified interaction for all date management. Tap the colored date text → inline date picker appears with Save/Cancel. For members without a date, a date input is always visible. All changes go through `setManualValidTill` which sets the date, clears any period association, and logs `validity_updated` to the activity log. The old `prolongateMembership` ("+Xmo") flow is completely removed. Save/Cancel buttons are full-width rounded buttons (not tiny text links) with loading state for mobile-friendly tapping.

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/members/member-row.tsx` — unified date picker UI, simplified props (no periods)
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/members/actions.ts` — `setManualValidTill` clears `membership_period_id`, logs `validity_updated`; `prolongateMembership` removed
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/members/page.tsx` — simplified props passed to `StaffMemberRow`

## Premium Referrals

**Request:** Admin can designate members as "premium referrers" with a configurable spin reward per referral.

**Changes:**
- Added `is_premium_referrer boolean` and `referral_reward_spins integer` columns to `members` table via migration `20260316000000_add_premium_referrals.sql`
- Added `setPremiumReferrer` server action in admin actions
- Rewrote `referral-tree.tsx` — each referrer row now has a "Premium referrer" checkbox and spin reward input; premium referrers show an amber "PREMIUM · X spins" badge
- Added "Add Premium Referrer" button at top of referral tree to designate any member
- Referrals page fetches all members' premium fields and builds member lookup maps
- Auto-reward logic in `staff/members/actions.ts` — after inserting a new member with `referred_by`, checks if the referrer is premium and increments their `spin_balance`

**How it works:** Admin goes to Referrals page, expands a referrer, toggles "Premium referrer" and sets reward spins. When staff creates a new member with that referrer's code in "Referred by", the referrer's spin_balance is automatically incremented by the configured amount. Activity logged as `referral_reward`.

**Key files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260316000000_add_premium_referrals.sql` — adds 2 columns to members
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/referral-tree.tsx` — premium toggle UI, inline spin reward input
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/referrals/page.tsx` — fetches premium data, builds member maps
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/actions.ts` — `setPremiumReferrer` action
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/members/actions.ts` — auto-reward logic in `createMember`

## Homepage Examples

**Request:** Generate showcase pages for 8 business verticals (sports clubs, coworking, coffee shops, tourist guides, Catalonia tours, bars, nightclubs, Barcelona events) so potential customers can see what their portal would look like.

**Changes:**
- Created `app/examples/verticals.ts` — static data for 8 verticals with sample events/services/quests, branding colors, taglines
- Created `app/examples/page.tsx` — full-width dark grid of vertical cards with gradient hero bars, content badges, bottom CTA
- Created `app/examples/example-portal.tsx` — simulated member portal component with branded hero, stats, quests/events/services sections, CTA banner
- Created `app/examples/[vertical]/page.tsx` — detail page with `generateStaticParams`
- Added "See examples →" link to landing hero and "Examples" link to footer
- Use case cards on landing page now link to `/examples/[slug]`

**How it works:** Examples live at `/examples` (outside the `(platform)` route group to avoid its `max-w-lg` layout constraint). Each vertical is a static data object defining name, colors, and sample content. The index page shows a full-width dark grid matching the landing page style. Clicking a card opens a simulated member portal with that vertical's branding. CTAs link to `/onboarding`.

**Key files:**
- `app/examples/verticals.ts` — 8 vertical definitions with sample data
- `app/examples/page.tsx` — examples index (full-width dark layout)
- `app/examples/example-portal.tsx` — simulated portal component
- `app/examples/[vertical]/page.tsx` — detail page per vertical
- `app/_landing/use-cases.tsx` — cards link to examples
- `app/_landing/hero.tsx` — "See examples →" link
- `app/_landing/landing-footer.tsx` — "Examples" link

## Content Creation UX

### Icon Picker & Textarea Descriptions

**Request:** Improve admin UX for creating quests/events/services — add icon picker, upgrade description inputs to textareas.

**Changes:**
- Added `icon text` column to quests, events, and services tables via migration `20260316100000_add_icon_field.sql`
- Created `lib/icons.ts` — curated list of ~60 lucide-react icons (social, food, entertainment, sports, rewards, etc.)
- Created `components/icon-picker.tsx` — searchable expandable grid, returns icon name string
- Created `components/dynamic-icon.tsx` — renders lucide icon by kebab-case name string (converts to PascalCase)
- All 3 admin managers (`quest-manager.tsx`, `event-manager.tsx`, `service-manager.tsx`): description changed from `<input>` to `<textarea rows={3}>`, added `IconPicker` to create/edit forms, added `DynamicIcon` display in list rows (shows when icon set and no image)
- All 6 CRUD server actions updated to read `icon` from FormData
- All 3 admin pages updated to include `icon` in select queries and data mapping

**How it works:** Admin clicks "Choose icon..." to open a searchable grid of 60+ icons. Selecting one stores the lucide icon name (e.g. "music", "beer") in the `icon` column. Icons render in list rows as a gray square with the icon inside (image takes priority over icon if both set). The `DynamicIcon` component converts kebab-case names to PascalCase and looks up the icon from the lucide-react module.

**Key files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260316100000_add_icon_field.sql` — adds `icon text` to 3 tables
- `lib/icons.ts` — `CONTENT_ICONS` array of curated icons
- `components/icon-picker.tsx` — searchable icon picker component
- `components/dynamic-icon.tsx` — renders icon by name string
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/quest-manager.tsx` — icon picker + textarea
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/event-manager.tsx` — icon picker + textarea
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/service-manager.tsx` — icon picker + textarea
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/actions.ts` — all CRUD actions handle `icon`

## Member Badges

**Request:** Members earn badges for completing quests. Admin creates badges and links them to quests. Auto-awarded on quest verification. One-time achievements.

**Changes:**
- Created `badges` table (id, club_id, name, description, icon, color, display_order) and `member_badges` table (member_id, badge_id, earned_at, quest_id, UNIQUE(member_id, badge_id)) via migration `20260316200000_add_badges.sql`
- Added `badge_id uuid` FK to quests table (links quest → badge)
- Created `badge-manager.tsx` — admin CRUD with icon picker, color picker, templates (First Visit, Social Butterfly, VIP Member, Event Regular, Top Referrer)
- Created `admin/(panel)/badges/page.tsx` — server component with earned counts per badge
- Added "Badges" card to content hub (`content/page.tsx`)
- Quest manager: added "Award Badge" dropdown (select from club's badges) in create/edit forms
- `addQuest`/`updateQuest` server actions now persist `badge_id`
- Staff quest actions (`completeQuest`, `approveQuest`): after awarding spins, if quest has `badge_id`, upsert into `member_badges` with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` (one-time only)
- Created `badge-collection.tsx` — member-facing component showing earned badges (full color with date) and locked badges (grayed out with lock icon + "Complete [quest] to unlock")
- Profile page fetches club badges + member badges, renders `BadgeCollection` above spin history

**How it works:** Admin creates badges in Content → Badges with name, icon, color. Then links a badge to a quest via the "Award Badge" dropdown on the quest form. When staff verifies a quest completion (either direct or approve pending), the system checks if the quest has a `badge_id` and upserts into `member_badges`. The UNIQUE constraint ensures one badge per member. Members see their badges on Profile — earned ones in full color, locked ones grayed out with the quest name needed to unlock.

**Key files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260316200000_add_badges.sql` — badges + member_badges tables, badge_id on quests
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/badge-manager.tsx` — admin CRUD with templates
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/badges/page.tsx` — badges admin page
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/content/page.tsx` — badges card in content hub
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/quest-manager.tsx` — "Award Badge" dropdown
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/actions.ts` — addBadge/updateBadge/deleteBadge + badge_id in quest actions
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/quest/actions.ts` — auto-award badge on verify
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/badge-collection.tsx` — earned/locked badge display
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/profile/page.tsx` — fetches and renders badges

## Configurable Member Login Mode

**Request:** Admin can choose login method for members: code only (current) or code + 4-digit expiry date (MMDD format) for extra security.

**Changes:**
- Added `login_mode text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'code_only'` to clubs table via migration `20260316300000_add_login_mode.sql`
- Created `login-mode-manager.tsx` — radio toggle in admin settings (code_only / code_and_expiry)
- Added `updateLoginMode` server action
- Settings page fetches `login_mode` from clubs, renders `LoginModeManager` at top
- Extracted login form into `login-form.tsx` client component that accepts `loginMode` prop
- `login/page.tsx` converted to server component — fetches club's `login_mode`, passes to `LoginForm`
- When `loginMode === "code_and_expiry"`: form shows second input (4-digit numeric, MMDD placeholder)
- Login action: if `code_and_expiry` mode, parses member's `valid_till` as MMDD, compares with submitted code
- Added 5 new i18n keys (EN/ES) for expiry code UI and error messages

**How it works:** Admin goes to Settings → "Member Login" (first section), chooses between "Code only" (default) and "Code + expiry date". When code+expiry is enabled, the login form shows a second field where members enter the month+day of their expiry as 4 digits (e.g. "1227" for Dec 27). The server parses `valid_till` → MMDD and compares. Members without `valid_till` get a clear error. Switching back to "Code only" hides the field.

**Key files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260316300000_add_login_mode.sql` — login_mode column on clubs
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/login-mode-manager.tsx` — radio toggle component
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/actions.ts` — `updateLoginMode` action
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/settings/page.tsx` — fetches login_mode, renders manager
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/login/login-form.tsx` — extracted client form with conditional expiry input
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/login/page.tsx` — server component fetching login_mode
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/login/actions.ts` — MMDD validation logic

## Role Visibility

Roles are managed by admin (creation) and assigned by staff. Members cannot see or change their own role — the role selector was removed from the member profile page.

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/members/member-row.tsx` — staff assigns roles via dropdown per member row
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/` — admin creates/manages roles
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/profile/page.tsx` — role section removed, no role data fetched

## Event Spin Rewards Allow Zero

Events can be created with 0 spins reward (matching quest behavior). The `min` attribute on the spins input was changed from `1` to `0` on both create and edit forms. Server-side already accepted 0.

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/event-manager.tsx` — create and edit forms with `min="0"` on spins input

## Quest Link Visibility After Completion

Quest links (URLs/emails) remain visible after a quest is marked done. Previously the link was hidden when `done && !isMultiUse`. Now the link renders unconditionally whenever `q.link` exists.

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/quest-list.tsx` — link rendering on line 84, no longer gated by completion state

## Admin/Staff Layout Cover Overlap

**Request:** Fix dark header/cover area bleeding into page content on admin and staff layouts.

**Changes:** In both admin and staff layout files, the content wrapper was split into two divs. The outer div gets `bg-gray-50 rounded-t-3xl pt-6` (only in the no-cover-image case) to create a solid gray sheet that overlaps the dark header. The inner div retains `px-4 pb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto space-y-6`.

**How it works:** The header uses `pb-20` padding and the content uses `-mt-12` negative margin to create an overlap effect. Previously this left transparent gaps where the dark gradient showed through. Now the content wrapper has a `bg-gray-50 rounded-t-3xl` background that covers the overlap zone. When a cover image is set, the content just uses `mt-4` with no special background.

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/layout.tsx` — admin layout with cover header and content wrapper
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/layout.tsx` — staff layout, same pattern

## Quest Reward Spins Allow Zero

**Request:** Allow admin to create quests with 0 spins reward.

**Changes:** In `actions.ts`, changed `Number(formData.get("reward_spins")) || 1` to a null-safe parse that preserves 0 (using ternary check for null/empty). Changed validation from `rewardSpins < 1` to `rewardSpins < 0`. Applied to all three functions that handle quest spins: `addQuest`, `updateQuest`, and a third quest-related function. In `quest-manager.tsx`, changed `min="1"` to `min="0"` on both add and edit form inputs.

**How it works:** The `|| 1` pattern coerced 0 to 1 because 0 is falsy. Now uses explicit null/empty check: `rawSpins !== null && rawSpins !== "" ? Number(rawSpins) : 1`. Server rejects negative values but allows 0. Client input allows 0 via `min="0"`.

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/actions.ts` — server actions `addQuest`, `updateQuest` with reward_spins parsing and validation
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/quest-manager.tsx` — client form with spins input fields

## Mobile Viewport and Horizontal Scroll Fix

**Request:** Fix admin panel overflowing horizontally on mobile Safari — content wider than screen, nav icons cut off.

**Changes:** Added `export const viewport: Viewport` to root layout with `width: "device-width", initialScale: 1, maximumScale: 1`. Added `overflow-x-hidden` to `html, body` in `globals.css`. Reduced admin nav item padding from `px-3` to `px-1.5`. Reduced PeopleManager card internal padding from `px-5` to `px-4` and row gap from `gap-4` to `gap-3`.

**How it works:** The missing viewport meta tag caused mobile Safari to render at ~980px default width then scale down. The `Viewport` export in Next.js 14+ generates the proper `<meta name="viewport">` tag. Global `overflow-x-hidden` on html/body prevents any remaining horizontal scroll. Tighter nav padding fits 5 icons on narrow screens.

**Key files:**
- `app/layout.tsx` — root layout with `viewport` export (width, initialScale, maximumScale)
- `app/globals.css` — global `overflow-x-hidden` on `html, body`
- `components/club/admin-nav.tsx` — bottom nav with 5 items, `px-1.5` padding
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/people-manager.tsx` — member management card with `px-4` padding

## Public Club Profiles

**Request:** Add a public-facing landing page for each club showing public content, with admin toggle to mark entities as public or private.

**Changes:**
- Added `is_public boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false` column to `quests`, `events`, and `services` tables via migration `20260311000000_add_is_public`
- Added middleware bypass for `/{clubSlug}/public` route (unauthenticated access)
- Updated all 6 CRUD server actions (`addQuest`, `updateQuest`, `addEvent`, `updateEvent`, `addService`, `updateService`) to extract and persist `is_public` from FormData
- Added "Show on public profile" checkbox to all three admin manager components (both create and edit forms), plus a blue "Public" badge in list views
- Updated admin page queries for quests, events, and services to include `is_public` in select and pass it to manager components
- Created new public profile page at `app/[clubSlug]/public/page.tsx`
- Added "Public Page" link (opens in new tab) to both admin and staff layout headers

**How it works:** Each quest, event, and service has an `is_public` flag (default false). Admin toggles this via a checkbox when creating or editing. The public page at `/{clubSlug}/public` is a Server Component that fetches club branding plus all entities where `active=true AND is_public=true`. Events are filtered to future dates only. The page inherits club branding CSS variables from the parent `[clubSlug]/layout.tsx`. No authentication required — middleware allows `/public` path through. The page shows: hero with cover image/gradient + logo + club name, member login button, then sections for events, quests, and services (only rendered if public items exist), and a "Powered by osocios" footer.

**Key files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260311000000_add_is_public.sql` — adds `is_public` column to 3 tables
- `middleware.ts` — public route bypass at line 70
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/actions.ts` — all 6 CRUD actions handle `is_public`
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/quest-manager.tsx` — checkbox + badge for quests
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/event-manager.tsx` — checkbox + badge for events
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/service-manager.tsx` — checkbox + badge for services
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/quests/page.tsx` — passes `is_public` to quest manager
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/events/page.tsx` — passes `is_public` to event manager
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/services/page.tsx` — passes `is_public` to service manager
- `app/[clubSlug]/public/page.tsx` — public profile landing page
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/layout.tsx` — admin header with "Public Page" link
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/layout.tsx` — staff header with "Public Page" link

## Service Card Style (Compact Row)

**Request:** Make services look like quests — compact row layout instead of large cards with full-width images.

**Changes:** Replaced the full-width hero image card layout in `service-list-client.tsx` and the public page services section with a compact row layout matching quest cards: small circular image (w-10 h-10 rounded-full) or flask icon placeholder, title + description + link inline, price and action button on the right.

**How it works:** Services now render as compact rows identical to quests in both the member portal and public page. Each row has: circular image or placeholder icon, title/description/link stacked vertically, and price + action button aligned right. The "Request"/"Requested" buttons use rounded-full pill style matching quest's "Mark done" button.

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/services/service-list-client.tsx` — member portal service list (compact row with action buttons)
- `app/[clubSlug]/public/page.tsx` — public page service section (compact row, no action buttons)

## Member Delete (Admin)

**Request:** Allow admin to delete members from the PeopleManager.

**Changes:** Added `deleteMember` server action to `actions.ts` that deletes a member by ID. Added a trash icon button to each member row in `people-manager.tsx` with a `window.confirm` dialog before deletion. Imported `deleteMember` in the component.

**How it works:** Each member/staff row now has a small trash icon button on the far right. Clicking it shows a browser confirm dialog ("Delete {code}? This cannot be undone."). On confirm, calls `deleteMember(person.id, clubSlug)` which runs a Supabase delete and revalidates the admin layout path.

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/actions.ts` — `deleteMember` action (delete by member ID)
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/people-manager.tsx` — trash button per row with confirm dialog

## /document Skill

**Request:** Create a skill that documents completed work into an architecture reference file for future AI context.

**Changes:** Created `~/.claude/skills/document/SKILL.md` with instructions to review the conversation, identify completed tasks, and append structured entries to `architecture-work-done.md`. Format includes: request, changes, how it works, and key files.

**How it works:** Invoked via `/document` at the end of a conversation. Reads the existing `architecture-work-done.md`, checks for duplicate topics (updates existing entries rather than duplicating), and appends new entries for each task completed in the session. Entries are architectural knowledge — not changelogs — designed to help future AIs work faster.

**Key files:**
- `~/.claude/skills/document/SKILL.md` — skill definition
- `architecture-work-done.md` — the living architecture reference file (project root)

## Interactive Calendar with Event Details

**Request:** Make the calendar view in the member events page interactive — clicking dates with events should show event details inline.

**Changes:** Added `selectedDate` state to `EventsClient`. Date cells with events are now clickable and highlight with club-primary color. An inline event panel renders below the calendar grid showing compact event cards (thumbnail, title, time, price, spin reward, RSVP button). Auto-selects the nearest upcoming event date when switching to calendar view. Month navigation clears selection. Past event dates show gray dots; upcoming dates show club-primary dots.

**How it works:** The calendar is a custom grid inside `events-client.tsx` (no library). Tapping a date with events sets `selectedDate` state, which filters events for that date and renders cards below the grid inside the same white card container. Tapping the same date deselects. Each card links to the full event detail page. RSVP buttons work inline using the existing `handleRsvp` function. Past dates show events but without RSVP buttons, labeled "Past".

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/events/events-client.tsx` — calendar grid, selectedDate state, inline event panel

## Past Event Protection (Timezone + Checkin)

**Request:** Fix bugs where members could see and sign up for past events, and could cancel RSVP after being checked in by staff.

**Changes:**
1. **Timezone fix:** Moved all upcoming/past date splitting from server-side (`page.tsx`) to client-side (`events-client.tsx`). The server was using `new Date().toISOString()` which returns UTC — causing events to appear as "upcoming" when they were already past in the user's timezone (e.g., UTC+1). Now the browser's `new Date()` handles the split correctly.
2. **Checkin protection (server):** `cancelRsvp` action now queries `event_checkins` first and rejects cancellation if the member is already checked in. `rsvpEvent` validates event date is not past. `checkinMember` and `checkinMemberById` reject past events.
3. **Checkin protection (UI):** Events page fetches checkin status alongside RSVPs. Checked-in events show a green "Checked In" badge instead of RSVP/cancel buttons — in both list view and event detail page.
4. **Event detail page:** `EventDetailClient` now receives `checkedIn` and `eventDate` props. Uses client-side date comparison to show "This event has passed" for past events, "Checked In" for checked-in events.
5. **revalidatePath:** Added `revalidatePath("/")` calls after RSVP and cancel mutations to bust Next.js page cache.

**How it works:** `page.tsx` fetches ALL active events (no date filter), all member RSVPs, and all member checkins. Passes a single `events` array with `hasRsvp` and `checkedIn` booleans to `EventsClient`. The client component splits into upcoming/past using browser-local date. List view shows only upcoming events. Calendar view shows all events with visual distinction (gray dots for past, club-primary for upcoming). Checked-in events are locked — no cancel/re-signup possible at either UI or server level.

**Important: timezone caveat.** Never use `new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0]` on the server for "today" comparisons against user-facing dates — it returns UTC which can be a day off from the user's timezone. Always do date splitting on the client side or use a club-level timezone setting.

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/events/page.tsx` — fetches events + RSVPs + checkins, passes all to client
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/events/events-client.tsx` — client-side date split, checkedIn badge, list/calendar rendering
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/events/actions.ts` — `rsvpEvent` validates future date, `cancelRsvp` rejects if checked in, both call `revalidatePath`
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/events/[eventId]/event-detail-client.tsx` — client-side past check, checkedIn display
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/events/actions.ts` — `checkinMember` and `checkinMemberById` reject past events

## Environment Separation (PROD/STAGE)

### Git Branching & Deployment Pipeline

**Request:** Separate staging and production environments across GitHub, Vercel, and Supabase so live clients are protected from untested changes.

**Changes:**
- Created `develop` branch as the staging branch, `main` remains production
- Created Supabase staging project `waiuymqdqzccatactrzo` with all migrations synced
- Created `.github/workflows/migrate-staging.yml` — auto-runs `supabase db push` on push to `develop` when migrations change
- Created `.github/workflows/migrate-production.yml` — same for `main` targeting production
- Created `supabase/seed.sql` with test data (demo club, test members, wheel configs)
- Added staging banner in `app/layout.tsx` using `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV === "preview"`
- Vercel env vars scoped: Production uses prod Supabase, Preview uses staging Supabase
- `staging.osocios.club` domain assigned to `develop` branch in Vercel
- Branch protection on `main`: requires 1 PR approval

**How it works:** Feature branches are created from `develop`. PRs merge into `develop`, which auto-deploys to `staging.osocios.club` (with yellow STAGING banner) and uses the staging Supabase. When staging is verified, a PR from `develop` → `main` deploys to `osocios.club` (production). GitHub Actions auto-migrate the appropriate Supabase project when migration files change. All PR/merge operations are done via `gh` CLI from terminal.

**Key files:**
- `.github/workflows/migrate-staging.yml` — staging migration workflow
- `.github/workflows/migrate-production.yml` — production migration workflow
- `supabase/seed.sql` — test data for staging/local
- `app/layout.tsx` — staging banner (line 46-50)

### Storage Buckets Migration

**Request:** Fix "failed to upload image" error on staging — storage buckets existed on production but not staging (they were created manually in dashboard, not via migration).

**Changes:** Created migration `20260313000000_create_storage_buckets.sql` that creates `club-images` and `event-images` buckets with public access, 5MB limit, and image-only MIME types. Includes RLS policies for public read, service role write. Uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` so it's safe to run on production where buckets already exist.

**How it works:** Storage buckets are now managed via migration instead of manual dashboard setup. Both buckets are public (images served without auth), limited to 5MB, and restricted to image MIME types. Upload code in `lib/supabase/storage.ts` uses the admin client (service role) which bypasses RLS for writes.

**Key files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260313000000_create_storage_buckets.sql` — bucket creation + policies
- `lib/supabase/storage.ts` — upload/delete functions using admin client

## Public Page Enhancements

### Language Switcher on Public Page

**Request:** Add EN/ES language toggle to the public club page — it was the only page missing one.

**Changes:** Imported `LanguageSwitcher` from `lib/i18n/switcher.tsx` into `app/[clubSlug]/public/page.tsx`. Placed it inside the hero `div` with absolute positioning (`absolute top-3 right-3 z-20`) using `variant="light"` for visibility over the dark hero background. `LanguageProvider` was already in the root layout, so no wrapping needed.

**How it works:** The EN/ES toggle floats in the top-right corner of the hero image on every public club page. Clicking it writes the `clubos-lang` cookie and triggers `router.refresh()`, re-rendering all server-rendered content in the selected language.

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/public/page.tsx` — switcher placement inside hero div

### Public Page Full Localization

**Request:** All hardcoded English strings on the public page needed to be localized — they were left in English even after adding the language switcher.

**Changes:** Replaced 7 hardcoded English strings with `localized()` calls: "Upcoming Events"→"Próximos Eventos", "Quests"→"Misiones", "Offers"→"Ofertas", "Free"→"Gratis", "Learn more"→"Más info", "at"→"a las". Updated `formatDate()` to use locale-aware formatting (`es-ES` vs `en-US`).

**How it works:** All section headers, labels, and date formatting on the public page now respect the user's language setting. Uses inline `localized(en, es, locale)` calls rather than dictionary keys since these are page-specific strings.

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/public/page.tsx` — all section headers and labels localized

### Hide Member Login on Invite-Only Clubs

**Request:** Admin toggle to hide the member login form from the public page when a club is invite-only.

**Changes:** Added `hide_member_login boolean DEFAULT false` column to `clubs` table. Created `updateHideMemberLogin` server action. Added sub-checkbox in `LoginModeManager` (only visible when invite-only is checked): "Hide member login from public page". Public page wraps login form in `{!(club.invite_only && club.hide_member_login) && (...)}`. Added `hide_member_login` to settings page query, admin component props, and public page query.

**How it works:** When admin enables invite-only AND checks "Hide member login", the login form disappears from the public page. The direct login URL (`/[clubSlug]/login`) still works — this only affects the public page. When invite-only is unchecked, the hide setting is preserved in DB but has no effect (both flags required). Added i18n keys for EN/ES.

**Key files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260321100000_add_hide_member_login.sql` — new column
- `lib/types/database.ts` — `hide_member_login` in Row/Insert/Update types
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/login-mode-manager.tsx` — sub-checkbox UI + handler
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/actions.ts` — `updateHideMemberLogin` action
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/settings/page.tsx` — query + prop passing
- `app/[clubSlug]/public/page.tsx` — conditional rendering of login form

### Contact Text Update (osocios branding)

**Request:** Change invite-only public page text from "Contact us through:" to reference osocios as the platform that handles member onboarding.

**Changes:** Updated `public.contactThrough` i18n key in both dictionaries. EN: "Contact osocios to get your member ID:", ES: "Contacta osocios para obtener tu ID de socio:".

**How it works:** On invite-only clubs using social buttons mode, the text now directs users to contact osocios (the platform) rather than vaguely saying "contact us". This supports the monetization model where osocios handles member acquisition.

**Key files:**
- `lib/i18n/dictionaries/en.json` — `public.contactThrough` key
- `lib/i18n/dictionaries/es.json` — same key in Spanish

## Offers System

### Offers Tile Grid View (Public + Member Pages)

**Request:** Replace the vertical list layout for offers with a compact tile/icon grid on both public and member pages.

**Changes:** Replaced the `divide-y` list layout in the public page offers section with a responsive `grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 gap-2` tile grid. Each tile: centered icon/image (w-10 h-10 rounded-full), name below, compact `rounded-xl shadow` card. Same grid applied to member page `offer-list-client.tsx` but with interactive features: price badge (absolute top-right), tap-to-request/cancel (onClick handler on the tile div), and "Requested" status pill.

**How it works:** Offers display as app-icon-style tiles in a 2-3 column responsive grid, grouped by subtype with localized headers. On the member page, orderable tiles are tappable — clicking triggers request/cancel. Price shows as a small badge in the top-right corner. Non-orderable tiles have no click handler. Descriptions are omitted from tile view for compactness.

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/public/page.tsx` — tile grid in offers section
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/offers/offer-list-client.tsx` — interactive tile grid with request/cancel

### Admin Offers Collapse/Expand (Accordion)

**Request:** Admin offers page shows all enabled offers fully expanded with all config fields — overwhelming with many offers. Collapse by default, expand on "Edit".

**Changes:** Refactored `OfferManager` component with `expandedOfferId` state for accordion behavior. `OfferRow` now has two states: collapsed (icon + name + toggle + status badges + Edit button) and expanded (full config form). Clicking Edit expands that offer and collapses any other. Save collapses back to preview. Added `isExpanded`, `onToggleExpand`, `onArchive`, and `t` props to `OfferRow`.

**How it works:** All enabled offers show collapsed by default — compact row with icon, name, and small status badges ("Orderable", "Public", price). Clicking "Edit" expands to the full config form (descriptions, icon picker, image upload, etc.). Only one offer can be expanded at a time (accordion). After saving, the offer auto-collapses.

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/offer-manager.tsx` — `OfferManager` + `OfferRow` with accordion state

### Admin Offers Archive

**Request:** Admin needs a way to soft-hide offers without permanently deleting them (toggle-off does a hard delete). Add archive/restore with a dedicated tab.

**Changes:** Added `archived boolean DEFAULT false` to `club_offers`. Created `archiveOffer` and `restoreOffer` server actions. Added "Archived" tab to `OfferManager` (appears when archived offers exist, shows count). Archive button in expanded edit view (red/destructive styling). Restore button on archived tab rows. All listing queries (member, public, staff) filter `.eq("archived", false)`.

**How it works:** Two paths to remove offers: toggle-off (hard DELETE, loses all config) vs archive (sets `archived=true`, preserves config). Archived offers disappear from member, public, and staff views but remain in admin under the "Archived" tab with a Restore button. Existing pending orders for archived offers can still be fulfilled by staff — archiving only affects browse/listing views.

**Key files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260321200000_add_offer_archived.sql` — archived column
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/offer-manager.tsx` — archived tab UI, archive/restore buttons
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/actions.ts` — `archiveOffer`, `restoreOffer` actions
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/offers/page.tsx` — passes `archived` to component
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/offers/page.tsx` — filters archived
- `app/[clubSlug]/public/page.tsx` — filters archived
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/offers/page.tsx` — filters archived

## i18n — Spanish Language Support

### Custom i18n System

**Request:** Add Spanish language support with browser auto-detection and manual EN/ES switcher in all portals.

**Changes:** Built a custom lightweight i18n system (no library) with: JSON dictionaries, `t()` translation function with parameter interpolation, React context provider for client components, server-side locale via middleware headers. Migrated ~285 hardcoded English strings across ~34 files to use translation keys.

**How it works:** The middleware reads `clubos-lang` cookie (or falls back to `Accept-Language` header for `es` detection) and sets an `x-lang` response header + persists the cookie. The root layout reads the header via `getServerLocale()`, sets `<html lang>` dynamically, and wraps everything in `<LanguageProvider initialLocale={locale}>`.

- **Server Components** use: `const locale = await getServerLocale(); t(locale, "key")`
- **Client Components** use: `const { t } = useLanguage(); t("key")`
- **Interpolation:** `t(locale, "member.welcome", { name: "Juan" })` → "Welcome back, Juan" / "Bienvenido, Juan"
- **Date formatting:** Uses `getDateLocale(locale)` → `"es-ES"` or `"en-US"` for `toLocaleDateString()`

The `LanguageSwitcher` component (EN|ES toggle) is placed in:
- Landing page: fixed top-right
- Onboarding: fixed top-right (via platform layout)
- Member portal: fixed top-right (via member layout)
- Staff console: in the header bar next to quick links
- Admin panel: in the header next to logout button

Switching locale writes the `clubos-lang` cookie and calls `router.refresh()` to re-render server components.

**Key files:**
- `lib/i18n/index.ts` — `t()` function, `Locale` type, `detectLocale()`, `getDateLocale()`
- `lib/i18n/server.ts` — `getServerLocale()` (server-only, reads `x-lang` header)
- `lib/i18n/provider.tsx` — `LanguageProvider` context + `useLanguage()` hook for client components
- `lib/i18n/switcher.tsx` — `LanguageSwitcher` component (EN|ES toggle, light/dark variants)
- `lib/i18n/dictionaries/en.json` — English dictionary (~285 keys)
- `lib/i18n/dictionaries/es.json` — Spanish dictionary (~285 keys)
- `middleware.ts` — `applyLocale()` helper detects locale, sets `x-lang` header + `clubos-lang` cookie
- `app/layout.tsx` — async root layout, dynamic `<html lang>`, wraps children in `LanguageProvider`

## SEO, Metadata & Structured Data

### Root Metadata Foundation

**Request:** Prepare the platform for public launch with proper SEO across all public pages.

**Changes:** Updated `app/layout.tsx` with `metadataBase` (from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` env var, defaults to `https://osocios.club`), title template `%s | osocios.club`, rich description with keywords, OpenGraph defaults (`type: "website"`, `siteName`, `locale`), Twitter card `summary_large_image`, and multi-format icon references (`.ico`, `.svg`, `.png`). Added dedicated `metadata` export to `app/page.tsx` with landing-specific title (absolute, overrides template), description, and canonical URL with hreflang alternates.

**How it works:** All pages inherit the root metadata template. Sub-pages only need to set `title: "Page Name"` and it renders as "Page Name | osocios.club". The landing page overrides with an absolute title. `metadataBase` enables relative URLs in all metadata (canonicals, OG images resolve against it automatically).

**Key files:**
- `app/layout.tsx` — `metadataBase`, title template, OG/Twitter defaults, icon config
- `app/page.tsx` — landing-specific metadata with absolute title

### robots.txt & Dynamic Sitemap

**Request:** Create robots.txt and sitemap.xml for search engine crawling and indexing.

**Changes:** Created `app/robots.ts` using Next.js Metadata API — allows crawling of public routes (`/`, `/discover`, `/examples/`, `/*/public`), blocks auth-required routes (`/*/staff/`, `/*/admin/`, `/*/login`, `/onboarding`, `/platform-admin`, `/api/`). Created `app/sitemap.ts` — dynamic sitemap that includes static pages with priorities (landing 1.0, discover 0.9, examples 0.5, legal 0.3), all vertical example slugs from `VERTICALS` array, and dynamically queries the `clubs` table for active+approved club slugs to generate `/{slug}/public` URLs (priority 0.7). Uses `createAdminClient` for the DB query.

**How it works:** Next.js auto-serves `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` from these route files. The sitemap regenerates on each request with live club data. The middleware matcher was updated to exclude `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, and `manifest.webmanifest` from auth checks (they were being intercepted as club slugs).

**Key files:**
- `app/robots.ts` — allow/disallow rules, sitemap reference
- `app/sitemap.ts` — static pages + dynamic club profiles from DB
- `middleware.ts` — matcher updated to exclude metadata routes

### OG Images (Code-Generated)

**Request:** Create social sharing preview images for all public pages.

**Changes:** Created 4 `opengraph-image.tsx` files using Next.js `ImageResponse` from `next/og`. All use edge runtime and render 1200x630 PNG images: (1) `app/opengraph-image.tsx` — default landing image with logo mark, brand name, tagline, feature pills; (2) `app/discover/opengraph-image.tsx` — "Find clubs, events & services near you"; (3) `app/examples/opengraph-image.tsx` — "See it in action" with industry category pills; (4) `app/[clubSlug]/public/opengraph-image.tsx` — dynamic per-club image that fetches club name, primary color, and tags from DB, renders club initial in a colored square with tag pills.

**How it works:** Next.js automatically discovers `opengraph-image.tsx` files and generates `<meta property="og:image">` tags pointing to the generated image URL. The club OG image is dynamic — each club gets a unique preview with their branding color and tags. All images use a dark background with the green brand accent. No external image files needed — everything is rendered from JSX at request/build time.

**Key files:**
- `app/opengraph-image.tsx` — default/landing OG image
- `app/discover/opengraph-image.tsx` — discover page OG
- `app/examples/opengraph-image.tsx` — examples page OG
- `app/[clubSlug]/public/opengraph-image.tsx` — dynamic per-club OG (fetches from DB)

### JSON-LD Structured Data

**Request:** Add schema.org structured data for search engines and LLMs.

**Changes:** Created `lib/structured-data.ts` with 4 helper functions: `getOrganizationJsonLd()` (platform Organization schema with name, URL, logo, description, Barcelona founding location), `getWebSiteJsonLd()` (WebSite with SearchAction pointing to `/discover`), `getClubJsonLd(club)` (per-club Organization with name, URL, logo, tags as keywords, address if available, `memberOf` linking to platform), `getItemListJsonLd(items)` (ItemList for directory listings). Added JSON-LD `<script>` tags to: landing page (Organization + WebSite), club public page (Club schema), discover page (ItemList of clubs).

**How it works:** Each public page includes `<script type="application/ld+json">` blocks with structured data. Google and LLMs can parse these to understand: osocios.club is an organization based in Barcelona, it has a search feature at `/discover`, each club is a sub-organization with its own profile, and the discover page lists clubs as an ItemList. The helpers return plain objects — pages stringify them inline.

**Key files:**
- `lib/structured-data.ts` — all JSON-LD helper functions
- `app/page.tsx` — Organization + WebSite JSON-LD
- `app/[clubSlug]/public/page.tsx` — Club JSON-LD
- `app/discover/page.tsx` — ItemList JSON-LD

### Page-Level Metadata Enrichment

**Request:** Add canonical URLs, hreflang alternates, and descriptions to all public pages.

**Changes:** Updated metadata exports on 6 pages: discover (changed title from "Discover | osocios.club" to template-based "Discover", added richer description, canonical, hreflang), examples (same pattern), vertical examples (canonical with slug, hreflang), privacy (added description about GDPR/Spain, canonical, hreflang), terms (added description, canonical, hreflang), club public profile (enriched `generateMetadata` to fetch tags and logo, generate description from tags, add OG data with logo image, canonical, hreflang).

**How it works:** Since locale is cookie-based (not URL-based), hreflang `en`, `es`, and `x-default` all point to the same URL. This tells search engines both languages are served from the same path. Canonical URLs use relative paths (resolved against `metadataBase`). Club profiles now have dynamic descriptions like "Club Name on osocios.club — tag1, tag2, tag3".

**Key files:**
- `app/discover/page.tsx` — canonical, hreflang, richer description
- `app/examples/page.tsx` — canonical, hreflang
- `app/examples/[vertical]/page.tsx` — dynamic canonical with slug
- `app/(legal)/privacy/page.tsx` — description, canonical, hreflang
- `app/(legal)/terms/page.tsx` — description, canonical, hreflang
- `app/[clubSlug]/public/page.tsx` — dynamic description from tags, OG with logo, canonical

### Brand Icons & PWA Manifest

**Request:** Create proper favicon, apple-touch-icon, and PWA manifest for the platform.

**Changes:** Created `public/logo.svg` — green (#16a34a) rounded square with a ring (the "O") and 3 dots representing community members. Converted via ImageMagick to: `app/icon.ico` (multi-res 48/32/16), `app/apple-icon.png` (180x180), `public/logo-192.png` and `public/logo-512.png` (PWA sizes). Created `app/manifest.ts` — PWA manifest with `name: "osocios.club"`, `display: "standalone"`, green theme color, icon references. Updated `app/layout.tsx` icon config to reference all formats.

**How it works:** Next.js auto-discovers `icon.ico`, `apple-icon.png`, and `manifest.ts` from the `app/` directory and generates the appropriate `<link>` tags. The SVG favicon remains as a secondary icon format. The PWA manifest enables "Add to Home Screen" on mobile with the green brand theme. All icon formats derive from the same `logo.svg` source.

**Key files:**
- `public/logo.svg` — source logo (green rounded square + ring + 3 member dots)
- `app/icon.ico` — multi-resolution favicon
- `app/apple-icon.png` — 180x180 Apple touch icon
- `public/logo-192.png`, `public/logo-512.png` — PWA icons
- `app/manifest.ts` — PWA web app manifest

## Analytics & Monitoring

### Vercel Analytics + Speed Insights

**Request:** Add analytics and performance monitoring for launch.

**Changes:** Installed `@vercel/analytics` and `@vercel/speed-insights` via pnpm. Added `<Analytics />` and `<SpeedInsights />` components to `app/layout.tsx` inside `<body>`, after children. Decision: skip Google Analytics at launch (adds GDPR cookie consent complexity under Spanish AEPD), skip Sentry (add when traffic warrants). Vercel Analytics is privacy-friendly (no cookies, no consent banner needed).

**How it works:** Both components are zero-config — they activate automatically on Vercel deployments. `Analytics` tracks pageviews, unique visitors, referrers, top pages, countries, devices. `SpeedInsights` tracks Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP) from real users. Data appears in the Vercel Dashboard under the Analytics and Speed Insights tabs within minutes of first visit. No env vars or API keys needed.

**Key files:**
- `app/layout.tsx` — `<Analytics />` and `<SpeedInsights />` in body
- `package.json` — `@vercel/analytics`, `@vercel/speed-insights` dependencies

## PWA & Web Push

The base PWA manifest at `app/manifest.ts` (see "Brand Icons & PWA Manifest" under SEO) covers the marketing site. Per-club PWA install and web push live in this section.

### Per-Club PWA Install (iOS Add to Home Screen)

**Request:** When a member installs the club PWA on iOS, the home-screen icon should be the club's logo on the club's primary color (not the generic osocios green), and tapping the icon should launch into that club's member portal — not osocios.club's landing page. Existing static manifest had `start_url: "/"` and global icons, so on iOS 16.4+ Safari (which honors manifest start_url) every install opened the wrong place.

**Changes:**
- New dynamic route handler `app/[clubSlug]/manifest.webmanifest/route.ts` — reads `clubs + club_branding` via the cached `getClub()` helper and returns a per-club manifest with `name`, `start_url: /{clubSlug}`, `scope: /{clubSlug}/`, `theme_color` from `club_branding.primary_color`, and `icons` pointing at the per-club icon route.
- New dynamic route handler `app/[clubSlug]/icon.png/route.tsx` — uses `next/og`'s `ImageResponse` to composite the club's `logo_url` (fetched and embedded as a base64 data URL) onto a square canvas filled with the club's `primary_color`. Two sizes via `?size=180|512` query param. Falls back to a white-on-color monogram (first letters of the club name) when `logo_url` is null or fetch fails.
- Member layout's `generateMetadata` extended to emit `manifest`, `appleWebApp` (with the club name as the standalone title), and `icons.apple` referencing the per-club icon route.
- `components/club/add-to-homescreen.tsx` rewritten: previously dead code, now an iOS-only banner that shows on the member home page with a compact card (Share icon + title + tagline + "Show me how" button + dismiss). Module-level `A2HS_TEST_MODE` constant gates whether the banner shows on every load (test mode) or once-per-club via localStorage (production). Rendered from the member home page (`app/[clubSlug]/(member)/page.tsx`).
- `middleware.ts` allowlists `/{clubSlug}/manifest.webmanifest` and `/{clubSlug}/icon.png` so iOS Safari can fetch them anonymously without being redirected to the member login. Same fix later applied to `/a2hs/*` static assets and `/sw.js` (see web push entry below). Also added `a2hs` and `sw.js` to `lib/reserved-slugs.ts` so club onboarding can't collide with these reserved paths.

**How it works:** When iOS Safari renders a club page, the member layout injects `<link rel="manifest" href="/{slug}/manifest.webmanifest">`, `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/{slug}/icon.png">`, and `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="{Club Name}">`. Both routes are fully dynamic (cached `public, max-age=300, s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400`), so a club owner editing their logo or color sees the new icon on new installs within ~5 minutes — no admin action, no migration, no per-club setup. Existing clubs adopt the feature automatically: clubs with `logo_url` get their real logo composited on their primary color; clubs without one get a clean monogram tile.

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/manifest.webmanifest/route.ts` — per-club web manifest
- `app/[clubSlug]/icon.png/route.tsx` — per-club apple-touch-icon (180/512), monogram fallback
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/layout.tsx` — `generateMetadata` injects manifest + apple-touch-icon + appleWebApp meta
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/page.tsx` — renders `<AddToHomescreen clubSlug={clubSlug} />` above the bento grid
- `components/club/add-to-homescreen.tsx` — banner with three modes (install / subscribe / hidden), test-mode flag, club-scoped once-only localStorage key
- `middleware.ts` — allowlists `/manifest.webmanifest`, `/icon.png`, `/a2hs/*`, `/sw.js`
- `lib/reserved-slugs.ts` — reserves `a2hs` and `sw.js`

### A2HS Walkthrough Modal (4-Step Visual Guide)

**Request:** The single-line "Tap the Share button, then Add to Home Screen" copy on the install banner is wrong for modern iOS Safari — the real flow is four taps and "Add to Home Screen" is hidden behind the "View More" button in the share sheet by default. Members were giving up before finding it. Replace the one-line text with a tap-through visual walkthrough.

**Changes:**
- New `components/club/add-to-homescreen-modal.tsx` — a bottom-sheet dialog (slides up from the bottom, backdrop fades in) with a scrollable vertical stack of 4 step cards. Each card has a numbered badge + caption + iPhone Safari screenshot. Uses a separate `visible`/`animating` state pair so the close animation plays before unmount. Body scroll lock uses `position: fixed; top: -<scrollY>px` (iOS Safari ignores `overflow: hidden` for touch scrolling — the fixed-body trick is the canonical workaround). Inner scroll container has `overscroll-behavior: contain` to block rubber-band chaining at boundaries. Focus moves to the close button on open, returns to the trigger on close. Escape key closes. Drag handle is decorative (no swipe-to-dismiss in v1).
- 4 real iPhone screenshots cropped from raw 1206×2622 captures down to the relevant UI element only (Safari bar / Share popup / share-sheet bottom row with View More / expanded share sheet showing Add to Home Screen). Resized to 800px wide JPEG quality 90 via ImageMagick. Files at `public/a2hs/step-1.jpg` through `step-4.jpg`, ~35 KB each, ~160 KB total.
- 8 new i18n keys for both EN and ES: `a2hs.tagline`, `a2hs.showMe`, `a2hs.stepsTitle`, `a2hs.step1`–`a2hs.step4`, `a2hs.close`. Old `a2hs.ios` and `a2hs.android` keys left in the dictionaries as dead keys.
- Banner `components/club/add-to-homescreen.tsx` changed from a single inline-text card to a compact card with a "Show me how" button that opens the modal. The animated `animate-a2hs-bounce` arrow from the previous iteration is dead CSS in `app/globals.css` (left in place — harmless).

**How it works:** The install state of the A2HS card now reads "Add to Home Screen / Install for quick access" + a "Show me how" button. Tapping the button opens the bottom sheet with the four screenshots and captions. Captions use the modern iOS flow: tap ⋯ → tap Share → scroll and tap View More → tap Add to Home Screen. Modal is fully accessible (`role="dialog"`, focus trap, Escape, backdrop tap), and body scroll is properly locked on iOS — earlier iterations had a sporadic scroll-chaining bug where touches leaked to the page underneath, fixed by switching from `body.style.overflow = "hidden"` to the position-fixed-and-restore-scroll pattern.

**Key files:**
- `components/club/add-to-homescreen-modal.tsx` — bottom-sheet dialog with 4 step cards, focus management, body scroll lock
- `components/club/add-to-homescreen.tsx` — banner trigger ("Show me how" button)
- `public/a2hs/step-1.jpg` — Safari bottom bar with ⋯
- `public/a2hs/step-2.jpg` — ⋯ popup with Share row
- `public/a2hs/step-3.jpg` — share sheet bottom row with View More
- `public/a2hs/step-4.jpg` — expanded share sheet with Add to Home Screen
- `lib/i18n/dictionaries/en.json`, `lib/i18n/dictionaries/es.json` — `a2hs.*` keys

### Web Push Notifications (Members v1)

**Request:** Members on iOS PWA install should be able to subscribe to web push notifications, and an admin should be able to send a test push from a new admin page that arrives on every subscribed member's device. Self-hosted, no third-party SDK, full data ownership. Phase 1 is members only — staff push and transactional triggers (member→staff on order, staff→member on approval, admin segmentation) are deferred to follow-up phases.

**Changes:**
- New Supabase migration `20260415150000_add_push_subscriptions.sql` creates `push_subscriptions` (id, member_id, club_id, endpoint, p256dh, auth, user_agent, created_at, last_seen_at), unique on `endpoint`, indexes on `member_id` and `club_id`, RLS policy permitting only the service role.
- `web-push` and `@types/web-push` added as dependencies. VAPID keypair generated via `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys` and stored in `.env.local` and Vercel preview(develop) + production as `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, `VAPID_SUBJECT` (mailto: jnamed@gmail.com), `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`.
- New global service worker `public/sw.js` (hand-written vanilla JS, no build step). Handles `push` events (decodes payload, calls `showNotification` with title/body/icon/data) and `notificationclick` events (focuses an existing PWA tab pointing at the click URL or opens a new one). Uses `skipWaiting` + `clients.claim` so updates take effect immediately. `middleware.ts` allowlists `/sw.js` so it serves at root scope `/`.
- `lib/push/client.ts` — browser helpers: `registerServiceWorker()`, `getExistingSubscription()`, `subscribeToPush(vapidKey)` (idempotent, returns existing subscription if present, otherwise asks `Notification.requestPermission()` then calls `pushManager.subscribe`). Internal `urlBase64ToUint8Array` for the VAPID key conversion the Web Push API requires.
- `lib/push/send.ts` — server-side sender. Two public functions: `sendPushToClub(clubId, payload)` and `sendPushToMember(memberId, payload)`, both returning `{ sent, removed }`. Internal `sendToSubscriptions` helper does the per-subscription try/catch with parallel `Promise.all`, lazily initialises `web-push` on first call (so missing env vars don't crash at import time), and deletes stale subscriptions in a single batch when the push service returns 404 or 410.
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/push-actions.ts` — `savePushSubscription` server action. Validates the member cookie via `getMemberFromCookie()`, validates the subscription has the three required fields, upserts into `push_subscriptions` keyed by `endpoint` (so re-subscribing from the same device is idempotent). Returns a `{ ok: true } | { ok: false, error }` discriminated union.
- `components/club/add-to-homescreen.tsx` evolved into a 3-state progressive install card: `install` (iOS, not standalone) shows the existing "Show me how" walkthrough; `subscribe` (standalone, not subscribed) shows a Bell icon + "Enable notifications" + "Never miss events and offers" + a Subscribe button that runs `subscribeToPush` → `savePushSubscription` → toast → hide; `hidden` once subscribed (forever — not gated by `A2HS_TEST_MODE`, which only gates the install state). Sonner toast for success/blocked/error states.
- 6 new i18n keys for both EN and ES: `a2hs.subscribeTitle`, `a2hs.subscribeTagline`, `a2hs.subscribe`, `a2hs.subscribing`, `a2hs.subscribed`, `a2hs.blocked`.
- New admin page at `/[clubSlug]/admin/push` — server component renders a `PushForm` client component with title (max 80) / body (max 300) / optional link inputs and a "Send test notification" button. `sendTestPush` server action validates the owner cookie via `getOwnerFromCookie()`, validates lengths, calls `sendPushToClub(session.club_id, payload)`, returns `{ ok: true, sent, removed }` or `{ ok: false, error }`. Sonner toast reports the outcome.
- The admin Settings page (`app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/settings/page.tsx`) gains a new `<CollapsibleSection title="Push Notifications">` (placed right after "Notification Light") containing a card link to `/admin/push`. The 4-tab admin bottom nav was deliberately not extended — the Settings card is the navigation entry point.

**How it works:** A member installs the club PWA via the existing walkthrough, launches it from the home screen, and lands on the member home page. The A2HS card detects standalone mode and queries the service worker for an existing push subscription. With no subscription found, it switches to the subscribe state. The member taps Subscribe; the browser shows the permission prompt; on grant, `pushManager.subscribe` returns a subscription object which is upserted into Supabase. The card hides and a toast confirms. Meanwhile the club owner opens Admin → Settings → Push Notifications, lands on the compose page, fills in title and body, and clicks Send. The action queries `push_subscriptions` for the club's rows, signs and POSTs the encrypted payload to each device's push service via `web-push`, and the service worker on each device wakes up and shows the notification. Stale subscriptions (404/410) are auto-deleted in the same call so the table self-cleans. Tapping the notification on the member device focuses an existing PWA tab at the click URL or opens a new one.

**Out of scope (deferred):** staff push subscription, member→staff transactional triggers (new order → push to staff), staff→member transactional triggers (approval → push to member), admin segmentation/scheduled sends/analytics, subscriber list UI, notification action buttons / images / badges. The Telegram informer (`/api/notify/[clubId]`) stays as the staff signal until a future phase.

**Key files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260415150000_add_push_subscriptions.sql` — table + indexes + RLS
- `public/sw.js` — service worker (push + notificationclick handlers)
- `lib/push/client.ts` — browser helpers (register, subscribe, getExisting)
- `lib/push/send.ts` — server sender (`sendPushToClub`, `sendPushToMember`, stale cleanup)
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/push-actions.ts` — `savePushSubscription` server action
- `components/club/add-to-homescreen.tsx` — 3-state install / subscribe / hidden card
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/push/page.tsx` — admin compose page
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/push/push-form.tsx` — title/body/link form (client)
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/push/actions.ts` — `sendTestPush` server action with input validation
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/settings/page.tsx` — collapsible section linking to `/admin/push`
- `middleware.ts` — `/sw.js` allowlist
- Vercel env: `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, `VAPID_SUBJECT`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` (preview(develop) + production)

## GitHub Workflow

### gh CLI Token Fix

**Request:** Fix `gh` CLI not having PR creation permissions, making the workflow inconvenient.

**Changes:** Removed the `GITHUB_TOKEN` export from `~/.zshrc` — it was a fine-grained PAT that lacked PR/issue permissions and was overriding the better keychain-stored OAuth token (which has `repo`, `workflow`, `gist`, `read:org` scopes). The keychain token was already set up via `gh auth login` but was marked "inactive" because the env var took precedence.

**How it works:** With the env var removed, `gh` uses the keychain token (set via `gh auth login` OAuth flow). This token has full `repo` scope — PRs, issues, releases all work. New terminal sessions pick it up automatically. The keychain token is managed by macOS Keychain and `gh` handles refresh. No manual token management needed.

**Key files:**
- `~/.zshrc` — `GITHUB_TOKEN` line replaced with comment

## Trello CLI (token-efficient replacement for Trello MCP)

### Local `trello` CLI wrapping the REST API

**Request:** Stop using the `mcp__trello__*` tools in `/work`, `/clarify`, and `/feedback-work` because they return bloated payloads that burn context tokens. Use a CLI instead.

**Changes:** Created `~/.local/bin/trello`, a ~100-line bash script that wraps the Trello REST API with `curl` + `jq` and returns compact JSON shaped for LLM consumption. Supports `list`, `card`, `comment`, `move`, `add`, and `lists`. Accepts list aliases (`critical`, `feedback`, `inprogress`, `qa`) so list IDs stay out of prompts. Reads `TRELLO_API_KEY` and `TRELLO_TOKEN` from env (already persisted in `~/.zshrc`). Board ID hardcoded to `69b17b5c03c1268fdd0dd0eb` (osocios.club). Updated `.claude/commands/work.md`, `.claude/commands/clarify.md`, and `~/.claude/skills/feedback-work/SKILL.md` to call the CLI and explicitly forbid `mcp__trello__*`.

**How it works:** In a Claude session, instead of invoking an MCP tool that returns a large JSON blob with every field Trello knows, the model runs `trello list critical` / `trello card <id>` / `trello move <id> qa` / `trello comment <id> "@mikitatrayan test: ..."` via Bash. The script only requests and emits the fields the workflows actually need (id, name, labels, due, members, short desc, checklists, last 20 comments), shrinking per-call output roughly 5–10×. `trello help` prints the full surface. Fails fast if env vars are missing.

**Key files:**
- `~/.local/bin/trello` — the CLI script (curl + jq wrapper, list aliases, compact JSON output)
- `.claude/commands/work.md` — daily work session; now calls `trello list/card/move/comment`
- `.claude/commands/clarify.md` — clarify-unclear-cards flow; now calls `trello list/card/comment`
- `~/.claude/skills/feedback-work/SKILL.md` — feedback processing flow; now calls `trello list/card/move/comment`
- `~/.zshrc` — holds `TRELLO_API_KEY` and `TRELLO_TOKEN` so the CLI works in any shell/session

## Operations Module

Cannabis-club operational layer (door control + dispensary) built for Ice Tray Weed Club. Off by default for every other club — flag-gated at the `clubs.operations_module_enabled` column. Built as Phases 0–4b, then hardened in Tiers A–E. Each subsection below describes a subsystem in its **current final state** after all hardening; phase/tier history is kept in git (`779b739` through `3eebda1`, plus later bug fixes).

### Operations module feature flag + gated routes

**Request:** Ice Tray wants a full ops layer (door + POS), but no other club needs it; ship it fully hidden unless explicitly enabled per-club.

**Changes:**
- Migration `20260416160000_add_operations_module.sql` adds `clubs.operations_module_enabled boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false`.
- `toggleOperationsModule(clubId, enabled, clubSlug)` in `app/[clubSlug]/admin/actions.ts` — guarded by `requireOwnerForClub(clubId)` (Tier A), writes the flag, logs `operations_module_toggled` to `activity_log`, revalidates admin + staff layouts. Mirrors `toggleSpinEnabled` but with audit logging.
- Admin Settings page (`app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/settings/page.tsx`) gains a `<CollapsibleSection title="Operations Module">` (placed right before Push Notifications) rendering `<OperationsModuleManager>` — a simple checkbox + amber warning banner. Every string localized via `t()`.
- Staff layout (`app/[clubSlug]/staff/layout.tsx`) selects both `spin_enabled` and `operations_module_enabled` and passes them to `StaffNav`, which filters both nav items independently (`components/club/staff-nav.tsx` lines 89-93).
- New route group `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/` with a `layout.tsx` that re-checks the flag via `getClub(clubSlug)` and returns `notFound()` if disabled — defense-in-depth alongside the nav filter.

**How it works:** Owner toggles the flag in Admin → Settings → Operations Module. When ON, staff nav grows an "Ops" tab and `/staff/operations/*` routes resolve. When OFF, tab is hidden and direct URL 404s. Other clubs see zero change regardless. Flip-off is non-destructive — all ops data is preserved and reappears when flipped back on.

**Key files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260416160000_add_operations_module.sql` — flag column
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/operations-module-manager.tsx` — checkbox + warning (i18n via `ops.admin.*` keys)
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/actions.ts` — `toggleOperationsModule` + `requireOwnerForClub`
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/layout.tsx` — selects flag, passes to nav
- `components/club/staff-nav.tsx` — filter both `spinEnabled` and `operationsEnabled`
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/layout.tsx` — `notFound()` gate
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/page.tsx` — dashboard with five cards: Door check-in, Live capacity, Sell product, Transactions, Product catalog

### Members: DOB, private ID photo, verification, search

**Request:** Cannabis clubs need age verification at the door — members need a date of birth, optionally a stored ID photo, and a staff-triggered "verified" flag. Staff needs a search + filter view.

**Changes:**
- Migration `20260416170000_add_members_ops_fields.sql` adds four nullable columns to `members`: `date_of_birth date`, `id_verified_at timestamptz`, `id_verified_by uuid REFERENCES members(id) ON DELETE SET NULL`, `id_photo_path text`. Plus an index on `(club_id, date_of_birth)`.
- Migration `20260416170001_create_member_ids_bucket.sql` creates a **private** Supabase storage bucket `member-ids` with `public: false`, no RLS policies (service role bypasses RLS; authenticated + anon have no access). Reads only via `createSignedUrl` for 30-minute windows from the server.
- `lib/supabase/storage.ts` gains `uploadMemberIdPhoto(clubId, file)` (returns `{ path }`, not URL), `deleteMemberIdPhoto(path)`, `getMemberIdPhotoSignedUrl(path, expiresInSeconds = 3600)`.
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/members/actions.ts`:
  - `createMember` extended with optional `dateOfBirth` and `idPhotoPath` args; orphaned photo blobs cleaned up on insert failure. Now guards with `requireStaffForClub(clubId)`.
  - New `uploadMemberIdPhotoAction(formData)` — staff-for-club authorized, reads `clubId` + `file` from FormData, 5 MB max, writes to private bucket, returns `{ path }` or `{ error }`.
  - New `markIdVerified(memberId, clubSlug)` and `revokeIdVerification(memberId, clubSlug, reason?)` — load member's `club_id`, authorize with `requireStaffForClub(current.club_id)`, stamp/clear `id_verified_at` + `id_verified_by`, write `id_verified` / `id_verification_revoked` to activity log.
- Staff member creator (`app/[clubSlug]/staff/members/member-creator.tsx`) — when `opsEnabled=true`, shows required DOB picker and optional ID photo input. All strings via `ops.memberForm.*` i18n keys.
- Members list rewritten as `MembersSearch` client component (`app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/members/members-search.tsx`) — search input (name or code), filter chips (All / Verified / Unverified / Expired). Verified/Unverified chips only render when `opsEnabled`. Per-row "Mark verified" / "Revoke" actions render inline when ops is on. Signed photo URL generated server-side per row and passed down; thumbnails open in a new tab. Page accepts `?q=` search param to prefill the filter (deep-link target for the entry-flow "Fix in Members →" link).
- Member profile page (`app/[clubSlug]/(member)/profile/page.tsx`) — conditional fetch of `operations_module_enabled` and (if on) recent `product_transactions` for the member. When `opsEnabled && id_verified_at`, renders a green "21+ Verified" chip under the member's name on the identity card. Stored ID photo is NEVER shown to members — staff-only.

**How it works:** Staff in an ops-enabled club creates a new member; DOB is required, photo is optional. DOB is stored as plain date; photo is uploaded to the private `member-ids` bucket, and only the storage path (not a URL) is saved on the member row. Staff marks the ID verified — must have DOB set first. Verification stamp is auditable via `id_verified_at` + `id_verified_by`. Photos are retrieved for staff UI via server-side `getMemberIdPhotoSignedUrl` (30 min expiry). Members see only the 21+ chip on their own profile when verified, never the photo.

**Key files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260416170000_add_members_ops_fields.sql` — DOB + verification columns
- `supabase/migrations/20260416170001_create_member_ids_bucket.sql` — private bucket
- `lib/supabase/storage.ts` — `uploadMemberIdPhoto` / `deleteMemberIdPhoto` / `getMemberIdPhotoSignedUrl`
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/members/actions.ts` — `createMember`, `uploadMemberIdPhotoAction`, `markIdVerified`, `revokeIdVerification`
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/members/member-creator.tsx` — DOB + photo inputs, ops-gated
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/members/members-search.tsx` — search + filter + verify/revoke rows
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/members/page.tsx` — signed-URL generation, `?q=` prefill
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/profile/page.tsx` — 21+ chip + recent purchases section (ops-only)

### Door flow: QR check-in, manual check-out, live capacity

**Request:** Staff stands at the door, scans members' QR codes, verifies age and ID, admits them. Members stay "inside" until a staff member explicitly checks them out. Live capacity dashboard shows who's in.

**Changes:**
- Migration `20260416180000_create_club_entries.sql` creates `club_entries` (`id`, `club_id`, `member_id`, `checked_in_at`, `checked_in_by`, `checked_out_at`, `checked_out_by`, `created_at`) with a **partial unique index** `idx_club_entries_one_open_per_member ON club_entries(member_id) WHERE checked_out_at IS NULL` — DB-level guarantee of one open session per member. Plus `(club_id) WHERE checked_out_at IS NULL` for fast capacity queries. RLS enabled with service-role-only policy.
- `@yudiel/react-qr-scanner` added (lazy-loaded in client components via `next/dynamic`, `ssr: false`). Camera uses `facingMode: "environment"` by default with a manual-entry fallback on every surface.
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/entry/actions.ts`:
  - `lookupMemberForEntry(clubId, rawCode)` — `requireStaffForClub(clubId)`, sanitizes input (accepts bare codes or QR-URL payloads), returns `LookedUpMember` with computed age, verified state, expiry state, any open entry id, and a signed photo URL.
  - `admitMember(clubId, clubSlug, memberId)` — authorizes, validates member is active + 21+ + has DOB + not expired + not already inside. Each blocked path writes a distinct audit row: `entry_blocked_expired`, `entry_blocked_no_dob`, `entry_blocked_underage`, `entry_blocked_duplicate`. On success inserts `club_entries` row + `entry_checkin` log.
  - `checkoutEntry(entryId, clubSlug)` — loads entry, authorizes via `requireStaffForClub(current.club_id)`, stamps `checked_out_at` + `checked_out_by`, logs `entry_checkout` with duration in minutes.
  - `checkoutAllOpen(clubId, clubSlug)` — closes every open entry in one UPDATE for end-of-night, writes one `entry_bulk_checkout` audit row with the count.
  - `searchMembersByName(clubId, query)` — ILIKE on `full_name` OR `member_code`, active members only, limit 10. For door staff when a member forgot their code.
- Entry page (`app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/entry/page.tsx` + `entry-client.tsx`) — three picker modes: Scan QR, Enter code manually, Search by name. Resolved lookup opens `EntryDialog` showing the stored photo, name, age chip (red if <21), verified chip, expired / expiring-soon chips, and an "Already inside" chip if applicable. When blocked, a red banner explains the exact reason (localized) with a "Fix in Members →" deep-link for fixable reasons (missing DOB, expired). Admit button runs the admit; if already inside, becomes a Check-out button.
- Capacity page (`app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/capacity/page.tsx`) — big count card with "Check out all" button (confirm-dialog), per-row entries with duration-since and a per-row "Check out" button. Server-rendered, client buttons trigger revalidation.

**How it works:** Staff at the door opens `/staff/operations/entry`. They scan a member QR (or type / search by name). The lookup surface shows the stored ID photo so staff can visually confirm identity. If age / DOB / expiry / already-inside blocks apply, staff sees an explicit reason and cannot admit. Otherwise tap Admit → a `club_entries` row is created, member is "inside". The capacity page shows a live count and list with durations. At end of night, one "Check out all" click closes every open session with an audited `entry_bulk_checkout` row.

**Key files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260416180000_create_club_entries.sql` — table + partial unique index
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/entry/actions.ts` — lookup, admit, checkout, checkoutAll, searchByName
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/entry/entry-client.tsx` — scan / manual / search picker, EntryDialog with blocked-reason banner
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/entry/page.tsx` — server component wrapper
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/capacity/page.tsx` — count card + open-entries list
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/capacity/checkout-button.tsx` — per-row checkout
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/capacity/checkout-all-button.tsx` — bulk close
- `package.json` — `@yudiel/react-qr-scanner`

### Product catalog + categories (admin CRUD, staff browse)

**Request:** Admin curates a dispensary menu — categories (Flower / Edibles / etc.), products with bilingual name + description, image, sold-by-gram or sold-by-piece, price per unit, stock on hand. Staff sees a read-only browse.

**Changes:**
- Migration `20260416190000_create_products.sql` creates `product_categories` (`id`, `club_id`, `name`, `name_es`, `display_order`, `archived`, `created_at`) and `products` (`id`, `club_id`, `category_id`, `name`, `name_es`, `description`, `description_es`, `image_url`, `unit 'gram'|'piece'`, `unit_price numeric(10,2)`, `stock_on_hand numeric(10,3)`, `active`, `display_order`, `archived`, `created_at`). RLS enabled, service-role-only policy.
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/products-actions.ts` — separate actions file (admin actions.ts is already 1700+ lines). Seven functions: `addProductCategory`, `updateProductCategory`, `archiveProductCategory`, `uploadProductImageAction`, `addProduct`, `updateProduct`, `adjustProductStock`, `archiveProduct`. Every function authorizes via `requireOwnerForClub(clubId)` (Tier A) and writes a `product_*` audit row. `adjustProductStock` takes a delta + optional reason and clamps to zero. `uploadProductImageAction` reuses `uploadClubImage` into the existing public `club-images` bucket.
- Admin manager (`app/[clubSlug]/admin/products-manager.tsx`) — tabbed Active/Archived view. Categories section: inline add row + edit row + archive/restore. Products section: collapsed-by-default product rows with expand-to-edit accordion. Edit form has bilingual name/description, image uploader, category + unit selects, unit price + stock inputs (labeled via `<label><span>…</span><input/></label>`), and a "Quick stock adjust" panel inside the edit form with a delta + reason input. "+ Add product" row opens a compact inline form (also labeled — see bug-fix subsection below).
- Admin Content hub (`app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/content/page.tsx`) — ops-flag-gated Products card added alongside Quests/Events/Offers. Shows active product count. Does NOT extend the 4-tab admin bottom nav (matches push-notifications precedent — Content hub is the nav entry point for this).
- Staff browse (`app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/products/page.tsx`) — server-rendered, grouped by category, bilingual name/description via `localize(locale, en, es)` helper. Out-of-stock items flagged red. Read-only; selling happens on the sell page.

**How it works:** Admin goes to Content → Products (ops-flag-gated card), creates categories and products. Each product is priced per gram or per piece; stock is tracked as `numeric(10,3)` for gram precision. Images upload to the public `club-images` bucket. Stock adjustments are audited with an optional reason. Staff sees a read-only browse grouped by category, with out-of-stock red markers. Selling decrements stock atomically via the sell RPC (see next subsection).

**Key files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260416190000_create_products.sql` — two tables + RLS
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/products-actions.ts` — all CRUD with `requireOwnerForClub` guards
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/products-manager.tsx` — tabbed manager with accordion rows
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/products/page.tsx` — server entry, loads categories + products
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/content/page.tsx` — Products card, ops-flag-gated
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/products/page.tsx` — staff browse

### Sell flow + transactions + void + Ohaus scale

**Request:** Staff picks a member, picks a product, enters or weighs the quantity, records the sale. Transactions have full history with per-product / per-day summaries. Void a transaction restores stock. Optional USB scale (Ohaus Navigator NV422) streams weight live.

**Changes:**
- Migration `20260416200000_create_product_transactions.sql` creates `product_transactions` (`id`, `club_id`, `product_id`, `member_id`, `fulfilled_by`, `quantity`, `unit_price_at_sale`, `total_price`, `weight_source 'manual'|'scale'`, `scale_raw_reading`, `voided_at`, `voided_by`, `void_reason`, `created_at`) with indexes on `(club_id, created_at)`, `(member_id, created_at)`, `(product_id, created_at)`. RLS + service-role policy. Also defines the `sell_product` PL/pgSQL RPC.
- `sell_product(p_club_id, p_product_id, p_member_id, p_staff_id, p_quantity, p_weight_source, p_scale_raw)` RPC — recreated in `20260416210001_harden_sell_product.sql` to **row-lock the product** (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`), verify the staff member belongs to the club (defense-in-depth beyond the action-layer auth), check product active + stock sufficient, decrement stock, insert the transaction, and insert the `product_sale` audit row — all in one transaction. Returns the new transaction id. Raises distinct error codes (`invalid_quantity`, `product_not_found`, `product_inactive`, `insufficient_stock`, `member_not_found`, `staff_wrong_club`, `invalid_weight_source`) that the action layer maps to friendly messages.
- Migration `20260416210000_add_void_product_sale.sql` creates `void_product_sale(p_transaction_id, p_club_id, p_staff_id, p_reason)` RPC — locks tx + product, restores stock, stamps void fields, logs `product_sale_voided`. Atomic, no read-then-write race.
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/sell/actions.ts`:
  - `sellProduct(clubSlug, input)` — `requireStaffForClub(input.clubId)`, calls the RPC, maps errors, revalidates products/sell/transactions paths.
  - `voidTransaction(transactionId, clubSlug, reason)` — loads tx's `club_id`, authorizes, calls `void_product_sale` RPC.
  - `exportTodayTransactionsCsv(clubId)` — staff-for-club scoped, returns a CSV blob (stable English headers: timestamp, transaction_id, product, unit, quantity, unit_price_eur, total_eur, member_code, staff_code, weight_source, scale_raw, voided, void_reason) for today's rows. Accountant-friendly.
- Sell page (`app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/sell/sell-client.tsx`) — three-step flow:
  1. Member: QR scan / manual / implicitly uses the entry's lookup action. After lookup, a red **inline banner** shows if the member is not ID-verified ("Confirm only if you already verified them at the door today"). Does NOT rely on a toast alone.
  2. Product: list grouped by category, out-of-stock products disabled. A **"Recent" quick-pick row** above the list keeps the last 3 sold product ids in this session's memory (tab-scoped, no persistence).
  3. Quantity: numeric input + optional scale panel when product is sold by gram.
  After confirm, shows a **green "Sale #TX-XXXXXXXX recorded — 42.00 €" receipt banner** with a "New sale" button. Steps 2 and 3 are locked (dimmed + pointer-events-none) until the user clicks New sale — prevents network-lag double-submission. On error, inputs stay intact so staff can retry without re-selecting.
- Transactions page (`app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/transactions/page.tsx`) — server-rendered, paginated 50/page. Top: today's revenue card + "Voided today: {count} · {total} €" sub-line. On page 0: "Today by product" summary block grouping today's sales into a per-product qty + revenue table. Each row shows product name, qty + unit, member code, staff code ("by ABC12"), total, timestamp, scale/manual marker, void reason (struck through if voided). Per-row Void button with required reason input. Header has an "Export CSV" button.
- Void button (`void-button.tsx`) — inline reason input, calls `voidTransaction`, toasts "Transaction voided; stock restored".
- Scale driver — `lib/hardware/scale.ts` defines the `ScaleAdapter` interface + `isWebSerialSupported()`. `lib/hardware/ohaus-nv422.ts` implements it over `navigator.serial` at 9600 8-N-1 (NV422 factory defaults), parses Ohaus print output (regex for signed decimal + `g|kg|oz|lb` + optional `?` unstable marker), streams readings via a callback. `TextDecoderStream.writable` cast to `WritableStream<Uint8Array>` because DOM lib types the variance too strict.
- Scale panel (`components/club/scale-panel.tsx`) — checks `isWebSerialSupported()` client-side to avoid SSR mismatch. On unsupported browsers (Safari/iOS) shows an amber note with manual-entry instruction, not an error. On supported browsers shows Connect button → native port picker → live weight readout with Stable/Stabilizing/Waiting status → "Use this reading" button. When used, fills the quantity input in the sell form AND sets `scaleReading.raw` so the sale records `weight_source = 'scale'` + the raw line. If staff hand-edits the quantity after reading, the scale flag is cleared automatically so no fraudulent audit trail can be produced.
- Member profile (`app/[clubSlug]/(member)/profile/page.tsx`) — for ops-enabled clubs, a "Recent Purchases" section lists the last 5 non-voided sales (bilingual product name, qty, date, total).

**How it works:** Budtender picks member (scan/manual) → picks product (stock-aware; Recent quick-pick for repeats) → enters or weighs quantity (optional Ohaus NV422 via Web Serial; manual fallback on unsupported browsers) → confirms. The RPC row-locks the product, validates stock + staff-belongs-to-club, inserts the transaction, decrements stock, writes the audit row — all atomic. A green receipt banner replaces the form and requires an explicit "New sale" click before the next transaction (no auto-clear, no double-submit). Transactions page shows today's revenue, voided-today tally, and a per-product summary at a glance. Void requires a reason, restores stock atomically, logs `product_sale_voided`. CSV export gives accountant-ready columns. Every sale appears on the member's portal profile under Recent Purchases.

**Key files:**
- `supabase/migrations/20260416200000_create_product_transactions.sql` — table + original `sell_product` RPC
- `supabase/migrations/20260416210000_add_void_product_sale.sql` — atomic void RPC
- `supabase/migrations/20260416210001_harden_sell_product.sql` — staff-wrong-club defense-in-depth
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/sell/actions.ts` — `sellProduct`, `voidTransaction`, `exportTodayTransactionsCsv`
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/sell/sell-client.tsx` — three-step flow + receipt + Recent shortcut + inline unverified banner
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/sell/page.tsx` — server entry
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/transactions/page.tsx` — revenue card, voided tally, per-product summary, pagination
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/transactions/void-button.tsx` — inline void with reason
- `app/[clubSlug]/staff/(console)/operations/transactions/export-button.tsx` — CSV download trigger
- `lib/hardware/scale.ts` — `ScaleAdapter` interface + `isWebSerialSupported`
- `lib/hardware/ohaus-nv422.ts` — Web Serial driver + Ohaus print parser
- `components/club/scale-panel.tsx` — connect / live weight / Use this reading
- `app/[clubSlug]/(member)/profile/page.tsx` — Recent Purchases section (ops-only)

### Multi-tenant authorization for ops actions

**Request:** Hardening pass found that early ops actions trusted caller-supplied `clubId` or resource ids without checking them against the session's club. Staff of club A could touch club B's resources. Close this before promoting to main.

**Changes:**
- `lib/auth.ts` gains two helpers:
  - `requireStaffForClub(clubId): Promise<{ member_id; club_id }>` — calls `requireActiveStaff()` and throws if `session.club_id !== clubId`.
  - `requireOwnerForClub(clubId): Promise<{ owner_id; club_id }>` — calls `getOwnerFromCookie()`, throws if missing or club mismatch.
  - Both throw; callers wrap in `try { … } catch (err) { return { error: err instanceof Error ? err.message : "Unauthorized" }; }`.
- Every ops write action switched to the new helpers:
  - `admitMember`, `lookupMemberForEntry`, `checkoutEntry`, `checkoutAllOpen`, `searchMembersByName` — `requireStaffForClub(clubId)` at the top (or after loading resource's `club_id` when the action takes a resource id).
  - `sellProduct`, `voidTransaction`, `exportTodayTransactionsCsv` — same.
  - `uploadMemberIdPhotoAction`, `markIdVerified`, `revokeIdVerification`, `createMember` — same.
  - All seven `app/[clubSlug]/admin/products-actions.ts` functions — `requireOwnerForClub(clubId)` at the top (previously had no auth guard at all).
  - `toggleOperationsModule` — `requireOwnerForClub(clubId)`.
- The `sell_product` RPC gained a `staff_wrong_club` defense-in-depth check (see above).

**How it works:** Every ops server action now authorizes before any mutation. Staff of club A calling a server action with a club-B resource id receives `{ error: "Unauthorized" }` and nothing is written or logged. The session's `club_id` is the authority, not the caller-supplied arg. The RPC layer re-checks for defense-in-depth. The pattern — load resource to get `club_id`, then authorize, then mutate — is the standard for all new ops actions going forward.

**Key files:**
- `lib/auth.ts` — `requireStaffForClub`, `requireOwnerForClub`
- every ops action file listed in the other subsections

### i18n coverage for the operations module

**Request:** Initial ops build shipped with ~20 hardcoded English strings across the new components. Ice Tray operates in Spanish. Every user-visible surface must localize.

**Changes:** ~100 keys added to both `lib/i18n/dictionaries/en.json` and `es.json`, namespaced:
- `ops.admin.*` — settings toggle + warning + toasts
- `ops.memberForm.*` — member-creator labels, placeholder, DOB required, photo help
- `ops.entry.*` — door-flow chips, buttons, blocked-reason strings, search UI
- `ops.sell.*` — step labels, member chips, inline unverified banner, product list, quantity placeholders, total, insufficient stock, Record sale / Recording, scale-captured note, unstable warning, receipt + New sale
- `ops.tx.*` — today's revenue, voided today, per-product summary, empty state, pagination, scale marker, voided reason, void/reason/confirm, staff column, export CSV
- `ops.capacity.*` — checkout confirm, checked out, Check out / Check out all / Check out all confirm
- `ops.scale.*` — Chrome/Edge-only notice, connect, opening port, label, disconnect, Stable / Stabilizing / Waiting, Use this reading, connected toast, no device, fail, place product
- `ops.logsFilter` — Admin logs filter chip

All admin-ops-manager components (OperationsModuleManager, StaffMemberCreator, MembersSearch, EntryClient's EntryDialog + picker, SellClient, VoidButton, CheckoutButton, CheckoutAllButton, ScalePanel, transactions/page.tsx) now consume via `t()` (client) or `t(locale, …)` (server). EN/ES parity verified via `jq -r 'keys[]' dict.json | sort | diff`.

**How it works:** Language toggle in any portal flips every ops surface together. Product/category names use a `localize(locale, en, es)` helper that falls back to English when Spanish is not provided. CSV export headers stay English regardless of locale (accountant software expects stable column names).

**Key files:**
- `lib/i18n/dictionaries/en.json` — ~100 new keys
- `lib/i18n/dictionaries/es.json` — same keys, Spanish values

### Operations activity-log filter

**Request:** Admin log viewer already categorizes events into Members / Spins / Quests / Orders / Events. Ops adds 21 new action types — they need their own filter chip and human-readable labels.

**Changes:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/log-viewer.tsx` — `ACTION_CONFIG` map extended with all 21 ops action labels + colors (teal for entry/verify, emerald for sale, rose for void/blocked, slate for toggle/product-CRUD). `OPS_ACTIONS` const lists every action name. `LogViewer` component gains an `opsEnabled` prop; when true, an "Operations" filter chip is added to the categories list covering all 21 actions. `BASE_CATEGORIES` (renamed from `CATEGORIES`) stays unchanged.
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/logs/page.tsx` — selects `operations_module_enabled` alongside `name`, passes to `<LogViewer opsEnabled={…}/>`.

**How it works:** Admin → Logs for an ops-enabled club shows a new Operations chip that filters the stream to ops events. Action labels render as "Sale", "Door admit", "Stock adjust" etc. instead of raw slugs. For non-ops clubs the chip is hidden and the viewer behaves identically to before.

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/log-viewer.tsx` — `OPS_ACTIONS`, enriched `ACTION_CONFIG`, `opsEnabled` prop
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/(panel)/logs/page.tsx` — selects + passes the flag

### Add-product form field labels (bug fix)

**Request:** Jeff reported that the admin Add-product form's inputs had no labels — only placeholders. Once an admin entered values, the placeholder disappeared and the field became anonymous (screenshot showed typed values "0100" and "01000" in the two numeric fields with no way to tell which was price vs stock).

**Changes:** `ProductNewForm` in `app/[clubSlug]/admin/products-manager.tsx` rewrapped each input/select in `<label className="block"><span className="text-[11px] text-gray-500">…</span><input className="mt-1 w-full …"/></label>` — matching the pattern already used in the same file's `ProductEditForm`. Five labels: Product name, Category, Unit, Unit price (€/g or €/ea, dynamic with unit selection), Stock on hand (g or units, dynamic). Placeholders removed where labels carry the same info.

**How it works:** The add-product form now shows persistent labels above every field, dynamically reflecting the chosen unit (€/g vs €/ea, g vs units). Matches the edit form's existing style. `CategoryNewForm` in the same file has the same placeholder-only issue — filed on a separate Trello card (GeMo4Ph3), not bundled per the /fix-bug skill's "no refactor while fixing" rule.

**Key files:**
- `app/[clubSlug]/admin/products-manager.tsx` — `ProductNewForm` lines 708+ now label-wrapped

## Bug-Fix Workflow

### `/fix-bug` skill — disciplined single-bug flow

**Request:** As ClubOS grows (three portals × ~dozen clubs × two languages × two themes × PWA + desktop × the Operations Module), bugs from Mikita and production need a consistent path rather than ad-hoc fixes. Encode the discipline (reproduce → root-cause → fix → staging → Mikita → main) into a skill.

**Changes:**
- `~/.claude/skills/fix-bug/SKILL.md` — the skill itself. Eight steps (intake → triage → reproduce → root-cause → plan → implement → verify → ship + QA) plus ten class playbooks (Layout, Functional-client, Functional-server, Data/RLS, i18n drift, Auth/cross-club, Performance, Integration, Env-specific, Security). Six hard rules: reproduce before fixing, name root cause in one sentence, every fix flows `develop` → staging → Mikita → `main` (no exceptions, not even P0), every fix lands in Trello `qa` with `@mikitatrayan`, no refactoring while fixing, `pnpm build` + `pnpm lint` clean on touched files. Composes with `superpowers:systematic-debugging` for non-trivial diagnostics.
- `.claude/commands/fix-bug.md` (gitignored, local) — command wrapper so `/fix-bug` is discoverable from the repo alongside `/work` and `/clarify`.
- Memory: `feedback_bug_workflow.md` + pointer in `MEMORY.md` — persists the "always staging first, no direct-to-main, stop-and-ask on unreproducibles" contract across sessions.

**How it works:** `/fix-bug <input>` accepts three input shapes: a Trello card id / short URL, a free-text description (which creates a new `feedback` card), or a pasted Mikita comment / screenshot path. The skill runs the 8-step flow, invokes `superpowers:systematic-debugging` for anything non-trivial, maps the bug to one of the ten class playbooks for Read/Usual-suspects/Write guidance, and always ends with `trello move <id> qa` + a `@mikitatrayan` comment naming the root cause and the exact reproduction steps. Cross-cutting patterns spotted during a fix go to a separate follow-up card, never bundled into the current fix. P0 emergencies use a `git revert` PR into `main` as mitigation — still PR-reviewed, not a bypass — while the real fix goes through the normal staging flow.

**Key files:**
- `~/.claude/skills/fix-bug/SKILL.md` — the skill definition
- `.claude/commands/fix-bug.md` — local command wrapper (gitignored with rest of `.claude/`)
- `~/.claude/projects/-Users-jeffsmith-Projects-osocios-osocios-web-app/memory/feedback_bug_workflow.md` — persistent contract
- `~/.claude/projects/-Users-jeffsmith-Projects-osocios-osocios-web-app/memory/MEMORY.md` — index pointer
